Whistler painted him in full evening dress but suggested that he hold a pink domino, an addition necessary to the decorative arrangement of the composition. Whistler worked on the portrait over a long period of time, even though the finished work ultimately looks like a rapid sketch. Acclaimed when exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1885; 'best portrait from the great Realist artists of the period'. 	1883	Dimensions: 76 1/8 x 35 3/4 in.

"	New York City, American	Art	Textile:Silk, satin, velvet,cotton	By the mid-1880s, crazy quilts were so popular that enterprising manufacturers offered them in ready-to-sew kits, which often included appliqués. This practice explains the strangely uniform quality of many crazy quilts, and makes those crazy quilts that are not formulaic seem all the more extraordinary. Each block of this quilt top is designed with unusual patterns, and the blocks seem to be composed of real scraps. There are some commercially produced elements, such as the cats and some of the embroidered motifs, which were probably marked with patterns, but the original aspects of this piece make it stand apart from the run-of-the-mill crazy quilts that exist in great numbers today.	1885	"

Viewers were particularly taken with the power of the woman, positioned between two boats bearing men: “This woman is not made of the stuff that is swept away. . . . She is transformed by the terrible beauty of the time and place; her stride is magnificent; she is part of the storm itself."	1883	16 x 29 in. (40.6 x 73.7 cm)	The Met, American Wing

It was almost perpendicular to the back and heavily upholstered. The 1880s versions were as padded and heavily embellished as a drawing-room hassock of the period. It was a popular conceit that the cantilevers of these bustles could support an entire tea service. To sustain the greater weight of the 1880s gowns, light and flexible infrastructures were created with flexible materials--wire, cane, whalebone--held together by canvas tapes or inserted into quilted channels.	1884–86		"The Met,

Each brass fixture features unusual panels inlaid with mother-of-pearl floral motifs, echoing the room’s overall decor. When originally installed, they were lit by gas. The flickering glow of the gas flame through the opalescent glass shades subtly played on the room’s large mirrors, the highly polished wood surfaces, mother-of-pearl inlay, and the gold-and-silver-stenciled walls.

New York City, American	Furniture	Satinwood, purpleheart, mother-of-pearl, brass, and mirror glass	"In 1881, Arabella Worsham, then-mistress of railroad magnate Collis P. Huntington, hired George A. Schastey & Co. to decorate her townhouse at 4 West Fifty-Fourth Street in New York City. The resulting artistic interiors would have been considered the height of cosmopolitan style in the early 1880s and were emblematic of Worsham’s quest to fashion her identity as a wealthy, prominent woman of taste. When Worsham married Huntington in 1884, she sold the house, fully furnished, to John D. and Laura Spelman Rockefeller, who made few subsequent changes to the decorations. 
 This dressing glass of satinwood and purpleheart is part of the suite (2009.226.1–.4) that furnished Worsham’s elaborately decorated dressing room, one of the preserved interiors now installed in The American Wing (Gallery 742). These objects were part of a decorative program that encompassed every aspect of the room, including the architectural woodwork, lighting, stenciled wall-treatment, painted ceiling and frieze, textiles, and other furnishings. The carved putti finials and marquetry ornament on the delicate dressing glass recall ornamental motifs in the architectural woodwork.
Athough few objects can be attributed to George A. Schastey & Co., the high quality of their work – as seen in this fine example – was comparable to other prominent firms of the Gilded Age, including Herter Brothers and Pottier & Stymus. At its peak in the early 1880s, the firm employed at least 125 people in its workshops. Their distinctive designs are steeped in Renaissance sources with flourishes from the Islamic world and the British design reform movement.
